Install Dependencies:
To install all required dependencies, run
pip install -r requirements.txt

Vast CLI Setup:
In order to allow the autoscaler script to create and destroy instances, you need to set up
the Vast CLI, which can be achieved by completing the 'PyPI Install' and 'Quickstart' sections
of this guide: https://vast.ai/docs/cli/quickstart


To set up the autoscaler simulation, you must start the flask webserver that acts as the interface
to the autoscaler, as well as run sim.py to drive the simulation.

To run sim.py:
python sim.py


Relevant parameters in the code:
num_iterations: The number of rounds of user requests that are sent to the set of instances
num_users: The number of concurrent users (each has a probability of generating a request)
prompt: The prompt that will be sent to the model from the user
reponse_length: The number of tokens to generate for each reponse


Understanding the output:
When the autoscaler starts, there will be no instances in your instance set, and it will take a little
bit of time to bring the instances online, as well as download the model to them. The autoscaler currently
starts with a pool of around 4 instances, and will scale up and down depending on the load generated by users.
Feel free to change some of the parameters in sim.py to test the autoscaler with different loads.
